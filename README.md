# Gauge Taiko Steps

Implements gauge steps for Taiko API, so that tests can be directly written without having to implement
steps for most common scenarios.

## How to use it

Install this npm package to your Gauge js project.

```bash
# npm
npm i @softrams/gauge-taiko-steps

# yarn
yarn add @softrams/gauge-taiko-steps
```

And update STEP_IMPL_DIR in \<gauge-project-root\>/env/default/js.properties to include
steps implementation from this package.

```bash
STEP_IMPL_DIR = node_modules/@softrams/gauge-taiko-steps/lib, \
                tests
```

And that's it. Start writing tests. You can check all available steps in the lib folder.
Here is a sample test showing some of the steps available
